        /*
        Expected trace output (image alt text):
        Trace showing a coroutine launched on a handler dispatcher with a
        `TraceContextElement` installed

        A new trace section named `coroutine execution` appears. Underneath it, an
        additional slice contains metadata, which in this case looks like:
        `;d=1;c=988384889;p=1577051477`

        The string before the first semicolon (`;`) is the name of the resumed
        coroutine. In the above example, no name was given to `launch`, and the tracing
        context was not created with options to automatically infer a name, so the name
        is blank.

        The other fields are as follows:

        *   `d=` is the depth, or how many parent coroutines there are until we reach
            the top-level coroutine.
        *   `c=` is the ID of the current coroutine.
        *   `p=` is the ID of the parent coroutine.

        Thus, in the above example slice, if we want to find slices belonging to the
        parent coroutine, we would search the trace for `;c=1577051477;`.

        Note: The parent coroutine will only be included in the Perfetto trace if it
        happens to run sometime during when the trace was captured. Parent coroutines
        may run in parallel to their children, so it is not necessarily the case that
        the child has to be created *after* tracing has started to know the parent name
        (although that helps).

        In the above trace, we also see `delay(1) ["A"]` is now traced as well. That's
        because `forceSuspend()` calls `traceCoroutine("forceSuspend") {}`.

        `traceCoroutine("[trace-name]") { }` can be used for tracing sections of
        suspending code. The trace name will start and end as the coroutine suspends and
        resumes.

        `BasicTracingTutorial.step5EnableStackWalker;d=1;c=1560424941;p=1105235868`

        Now, we can see our coroutine has a name:
        `BasicTracingTutorial.step5EnableStackWalker;d=1;c=1560424941;p=1105235868`.

        We can also see a slice named `walkStackForClassName` that occurs before the
        `launch`. This is where the coroutine trace context infers the name of the
        newly launched coroutine by inspecting the stack trace to see where it was
        created.

        One downside of using `walkStackForDefaultNames = true` is that it is expensive,
        sometimes taking longer than 1 millisecond to infer the name of a class,
        so it should be used sparingly. As we'll see further on, some parts of
        `kotlinx.coroutines` are written such that there is no way for us to insert a
        custom coroutine context, thus making `walkStackForClassName` unavoidable.

        same as the name in the previous step, except this name is derived using the
        classname of the supplied lambda, `block::class.simpleName`, which is much
        faster. We also see that `walkStackForClassName` was not called.
